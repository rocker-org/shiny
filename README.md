Docker for Shiny Server
=======================

This is a Dockerfile for Shiny Server on Debian "testing". It is based on the r-base image.

The image is available from [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/rocker/shiny/).

As of January 2017, the Shiny Server log is written to `stdout` and can be viewed using `docker logs`. The logs for individual apps are in the `/var/log/shiny-server` directory, as described in the [Shiny Server Administrator's Guide]( http://docs.rstudio.com/shiny-server/#application-error-logs)

## Usage:

To run a temporary container with Shiny Server:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 rocker/shiny
```


To expose a directory on the host to the container use `-v <host_dir>:<container_dir>`. The following command will use one `/srv/shinyapps` as the Shiny app directory and `/srv/shinylog` as the directory for Shiny app logs. Note that if the directories on the host don't already exist, they will be created automatically.:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 \
    -v /srv/shinyapps/:/srv/shiny-server/ \
    -v /srv/shinylog/:/var/log/shiny-server/ \
    rocker/shiny
```

If you have an app in /srv/shinyapps/appdir, you can run the app by visiting http://localhost:3838/appdir/. (If using boot2docker, visit http://192.168.59.103:3838/appdir/)


In a real deployment scenario, you will probably want to run the container in detached mode (`-d`) and listening on the host's port 80 (`-p 80:3838`):

```sh
docker run -d -p 80:3838 \
    -v /srv/shinyapps/:/srv/shiny-server/ \
    -v /srv/shinylog/:/var/log/shiny-server/ \
    rocker/shiny
```

## A debian:stable build

The base docker image for this Dockerfile uses `r-base:latest`, which in turn uses `debian:testing`. For a `debian:stable` shiny-server, use the [rocker/rstudio](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio/) image. The image contains an [option](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/tree/master/rstudio#add-shiny-server-on-start-up-with-e-addshiny) to enable shiny-server at runtime. A minimal Dockerfile example:

```
FROM rocker/rstudio:3.4.3

EXPOSE 3838

RUN export ADD="shiny" && \
    bash /etc/cont-init.d/add

CMD ["/usr/bin/shiny-server"]
```
